# Measure_tree

To compile and run just enter the command g++ -o proj2 Measure_tree_basics.cc. Then run using ./proj2. Currently the main function contains the intervaltest.c code, however that can be commented out to make room for a different main function. 

Responsibilities: 
Andrew: interval and tree struct, create_tree, create_interval, min, max, update_measure, left_rotation, right_rotation, insert, query_length, max_submeasure, destroy_tree

Ben: delete_interval, stack_n_t, create_stack, stack_empty, push, pop, top_element, remove_stack, root_key, print_submeasure

note: insert and delete functions were implemented and edited by both authors.
